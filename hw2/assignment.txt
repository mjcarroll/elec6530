ELEC5530 / 6530 Mobile Robots
HW2
Assigned Fri. 8/26 Due Wed. 8/31


Rules: This is a team assignment. Your team may consist of 1, 2, or 3 people.
Each team should select a “team leader.” You only need to upload your material
under the team leader’s account, but make sure to list each team member’s name
on the cover page.



(1) Consider a differential drive wheeled robot. The wheels are located on each
side, on the centerline of the chassis, and there is a caster so the robot is
statically stable. Derive a set of equations that yield the pose as a function
of the commanded wheel velocities. The equations should give x, y, and θ in the
global coordinate frame.

(2) Choose two simple cases to illustrate that your equations give the correct
answers (for those cases).

(3) 6530 students – write a MATLAB simulation of your equations. Include the
code so I can run it.


UPLOAD all relevant files to Blackboard, and also give me hardcopy. The
assignment is not considered submitted until I have both hardcopy and
Blackboard versions.
